# A/B Testing – Conversion Rate Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs A/B Testing on a marketing dataset to evaluate whether advertisements (Ad group) lead to higher conversions compared to public service announcements (PSA group).

The analysis uses statistical hypothesis testing to support data-driven decision-making.

---

## Objectives
- Load and explore marketing dataset  
- Identify control (PSA) and test (Ad) groups  
- Define null and alternative hypotheses  
- Calculate conversion rates  
- Perform t-test for significance  
- Compute confidence interval  
- Visualize group performance  
- Provide final business recommendation  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- scipy  
- matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Files
- task11_abtest.ipynb → Main notebook  
- ab_test_summary.csv → Summary of results  
- final_recommendation.txt → Business decision

## Hypothesis
H0: There is no difference in conversion rate between PSA and Ad groups.  
H1: There is a difference in conversion rate between PSA and Ad groups.  

Alpha = 0.05

---

## Key Results
- Conversion rate calculated for both groups  
- Statistical test performed  
- p-value used to determine significance  
- Confidence interval estimated  

---

## Conclusion
The Ad group shows a higher conversion rate than the PSA group and the difference is statistically significant. Therefore, the advertisement version should be implemented.

---

## Outcome
This project demonstrates practical understanding of A/B testing and hypothesis testing for business analytics.
